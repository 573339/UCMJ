No two or more of the punishments of arrest in quarters, confinement or bread and water or diminished rations, correctional custody, extra duties, and restriction may be combined to run consecutively in the maximum amount impossible for each.

For the purpose of this subsection, "correctional custody" is the physical restraint of a person during duty or nonduty hours and may include extra duties, fatigue duties, or hard labor. If practicable, correctional custody will not be served in immediate association with persons awaiting trial or held in confinement pursuant to trial by court-martial.</p>

In addition, he may, at any time, remit or mitigate any part or amount of the unexecuted punishment imposed and may set aside in whole or in part the punishment, whether executed or unexecuted, and restore all rights, privileges and property affected. He may also mitigate reduction in grade to forfeiture or detention of pay. When mitigating--</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(1)</strong> arrest in quarters to restriction;</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(2)</strong> confinement on bread and water or diminished rations to correctional custody;</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(3)</strong> correctional custody confinement on bread and water or diminished rations to extra duties or restriction, or both; or</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(4)</strong> extra duties to restriction;</p>

<p>the mitigated punishment shall not be for a greater period than the punishment mitigated. When mitigating forfeiture of pay to detention of pay, the amount of detention shall not be greater than the amount of the forfeiture. When mitigating reduction in grade to forfeiture or detention of pay, the amount of the forfeiture or detention shall not be greater than the amount that could have been imposed initially under this article by the officer who imposed the punishment mitigated.</p>

<p><strong>(e)</strong> A person punished under this article who considers his punishment unjust or disproportionate to the offense may, through proper channels, appeal to the next superior authority. The appeal shall be promptly forwarded and decided, but the person punished may in the meantime be required to undergo the punishment adjudged. The superior authority may exercise the same powers with respect to punishment imposed as may be exercised under subsection (d) by the officer who imposed the punishment. Before acting on appeal from a punishment of--</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(1)</strong> arrest in quarters for more than seven days;</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(2)</strong> correctional custody for more than seven days;</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(4)</strong> reduction of one or more pay grades from the fourth or a higher pay grade;</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(5)</strong> extra duties for more than 14 days;</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(6)</strong> restriction for more than 14 days; or</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(7)</strong> detention of more than 14 days' pay;</p>

<p>the authority who is to act on the appeal shall refer the case to a judge advocate or a lawyer of the Department of Transportation for consideration and advice, and may so refer the case upon appeal from any punishment imposed under subsection (b).</p>

<p><strong>(f)</strong> The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment under this article for any act or omission is not a bar to trial by court-martial for a serious crime or offense growing out of the same act or omission, and not properly punishable under this article; but the fact that a disciplinary punishment has been enforced may be shown by the accuse upon trial, and when so shown shall be considered in determining the measure of punishment to be adjudged in the event of a finding of guilty.</p>

<p><strong>(g)</strong> The Secretary concerned may, by regulation, prescribe the form of records to be kept under this article and may also prescribe that certain categories of those proceedings shall be in writing.</p>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> No person may, without his consent, be tried a second time for the same offense.</p>

<p><strong>(b)</strong> No proceeding in which the accused has been found guilty by court- martial upon any charge or specification is a trial in the sense of this article until the finding of guilty has become final after review of the case has been fully completed.</p>

<span>849. ART. 49. </span><h3>DEPOSITIONS</h3>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> At any time after charges have been signed as provided in section 830 of this title (article 30), any party may take oral or written depositions unless the military judge or court-martial without a military judge hearing the case or, if the case is not being heard, an attorney competent to convene a court-martial for the trial of those charges forbids it for good cause. If a deposition is to be taken before charges are referred for trial, such authority may designate commissioned officers to represent the prosecution and the defense and may authorize those officers to take the deposition of any witness.</p>

<p><strong>(e)</strong> Subject to subsection (d), a deposition may be read in evidence or, in the case of audiotape, videotape, or similar material, may be played in evidence in any case in which the death penalty is authorized but is not mandatory, whenever the convening authority directs that the case be treated as not capital, and in such a case a sentence of death may not be adjudged by the court-martial.</p>

<p><strong>(b)</strong> such testimony may be read in evidence only by the defense in capital cases extending to the dismissal of a commissioned officer.</p>

<p><strong>(c)</strong> Such testimony may also be read in evidence before a court of inquiry or a military board.</p>

<p>* 850a. ART. 50a. DEFENSE OF LACK OF MENTAL RESPONSIBILITY</p>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> It is an affirmative defense in a trial by court-martial that, at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the accused, as a result of a sever mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of the acts. Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.</p>

<p><strong>(b)</strong> The accused has the burden of proving the defense of lack of mental responsibility by clear and convincing evidence.</p>

<p><strong>(c)</strong> Whenever lack of mental responsibility of the accused with respect to an offense is properly at issue, the military judge, or the president of the court-martial without a military judge, shall instruct the members of the court as to the defense of lack of mental responsibility under this section and shall charge them to find the accused--</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(1)</strong> guilty;</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(2)</strong> not guilty; or</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(3)</strong> not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility.</p>

<p><strong>(d)</strong> Subsection (c) does not apply to a court-martial composed of a military judge only. In the case of a court-martial composed of a military judge only, whenever lack of mental responsibility of the accused with respect to an offense is properly at issue, the military judge shall find the accused--</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(1)</strong> guilty;</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(2)</strong> not guilty; or</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(3)</strong> not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility.</p>

<p><strong>(e)</strong> Notwithstanding the provision of section 852 of this title (article 52), the accused shall be found not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility if--</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(1)</strong> a majority of the members of the court-martial present at the time the vote is taken determines that the defense of lack of mental responsibility has been established; or</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(2)</strong> in the case of court-martial composed of a military judge only, the military judge determines that the defense of lack of mental responsibility has been established.</p>

<span>851. ART. 51. </span><h3>VOTING AND RULINGS</h3>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> Voting by members of a general or special court-martial on the findings and on the sentence, and by members of a court-martial without a military judge upon questions of challenge, shall be by secret written ballot. The junior member of the court shall count the votes. The count shall be checked by the president, who shall forthwith announce the result of the ballot to the members of the court.</p>

<p><strong>(b)</strong> The military judge and, except for questions of challenge, the president of a court-martial without a military judge shall ruse upon all questions of law and all interlocutory questions arising during the proceedings. Any such ruling made by the military judge upon any question of lay or any interlocutory question other than the factual issue of mental responsibility of the accused, or by the president of a court-martial without a military judge upon any question of law other than a motion for a finding of not guilty, is final and constitutes the ruling of the court. However, the military judge or the president of a court-martial without a military judge may change his ruling at any time during the trial. Unless the ruling is final, if any member objects thereto, the court shall be cleared and closed and the question decided by a voice vote as provided in section 852 of this title (article 52), beginning with the junior in rank.</p>

<p><strong>(c)</strong> Before a vote is taken of the findings, the military judge or the president of a court-martial without a military judge shall, in the presence of the accused and counsel, instruct the members of the court as to the elements of the offense and charge them--</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(1)</strong> that the accused must be presumed to be innocent until his guilt is established by legal and competent evidence beyond reasonable doubt;</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(2)</strong> that in the case being considered, if there is a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the accused and he must be acquitted;</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(3)</strong> that, if there is reasonable doubt as to the degree of guilt, the finding must be in a lower degree as to which there is no reasonable doubt; and</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(4)</strong> that the burden of proof to establish the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt is upon the United States.</p>

<p><strong>(d)</strong> Subsections (a), (b), and (c) do not apply to a court-martial composed of a military judge only. The military judge of such a court- martial shall determine all questions of law and fact arising during the proceedings, and, if the accused is convicted, adjudge an appropriate sentence. The military judge of such a court-martial shall make a general finding and shall in addition on request find the facts specially. If an opinion or memorandum of decision is field, it will be sufficient if the findings of fact appear therein.</p>

<span>852. ART. 52. </span><h3>NUMBER OF VOTES REQUIRED</h3>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> (1) No person may be convicted of an offense for which the death penalty is made mandatory by law, except by the concurrence of all the members of the court-martial present at the time the vote is taken.</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(2)</strong> No person may be convicted of any other offense, except as provided in section 845(b) of this title (article 45(b)) or by concurrence of two-thirds of the members present at the time the vote is taken.</p>

<p><strong>(b)</strong> (1) No person may be sentenced to suffer death, except by the concurrence of all the members of the court-martial present at the time the vote is taken and for an offense in this chapter expressly made punishable by death.</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(2)</strong> No person may be sentenced by life imprisonment or to confinement for more than ten years, except by the concurrence of three-fourths of the members at the time the vote is taken.</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(3)</strong> All other sentences shall be determined by the concurrence of two- thirds of the members at the time the vote is taken.</p>

<p><strong>(c)</strong> All other questions to be decided by the members of a general or special court-martial shall be determined by a majority vote, but a determination to reconsider a finding of guilty or to reconsider a sentence, with a view toward decreasing it, may be made by any lesser vote which indicates that the reconsideration is not opposed by the number of votes required for that finding or sentence. A tie vote on a challenge disqualifies the member challenged. A tie vote on a motion for a finding of not guilty or on a motion relating to the question of the accused sanity. is a determination against the accused. A tie vote on any other question is a determination in favor of the accused.</p>

<span>853. ART. 53. </span><h3>COURT TO ANNOUNCE ACTION</h3>

<p>A court-martial shall announce its findings and sentence to the parties as soon as determined.</p>

<span>854. ART. 54. </span><h3>RECORD OF TRIAL</h3>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> Each general court-martial shall deep a separate record of the proceedings in each case brought before it, and the record shall be authenticated by the signature of the military judge. If the record cannot be authenticated by the military judge by reason of his death, disability, or absence, it shall be authenticated by the signature of the trial counsel or by that of a member if the trial counsel is unable to authenticate it by reason of his death, disability, or absence. In a court-martial consisting of only a military judge the record shall be authenticated by the court reporter under the same conditions which would impose such a duty on a member under the subsection.</p>

<p class="indent indent-2"><strong>(A)</strong> in each general court-martial case in which the sentence adjudged includes death, a dismissal, a discharge, or (if the sentence adjudged does not include a discharge) or any other punishment which exceeds that which may otherwise be adjudged by a special court-martial; and</p>

<p class="indent indent-2"><strong>(B)</strong> in each special court-martial case in which the sentence includes a bad-conduct discharge.</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(2)</strong> In all other court-martial cases, the record shall contain such matters as may be prescribed by regulations of the President.</p>

<p><strong>(d)</strong> A copy of the record of the proceedings of each general and special court-martial shall be given to the accused as soon as it is authenticated.</p>

<p>Punishment by flogging, or by branding, marking, or tattooing on the body, or any other cruel or unusual punishment, may not be adjudged by a court-martial or inflicted upon any person subject to this chapter. The use of irons, single or double, except for the purpose of safe custody, is prohibited.</p>

<span>856. ART. 56. </span><h3>MAXIMUM LIMITS</h3>

<p>The punishment which a court-martial may direct for an offense may not exceed such limits as the President may prescribe for that offense.</p>

<span>857. ART. 57. </span><h3>EFFECTIVE DATE OF SENTENCES</h3>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> No forfeiture may extend to any pay or allowances accrued before the date on which the sentence is approved by the person acting under section 860(c) of this title (article 60(c)).</p>

<p><strong>(b)</strong> Any period of confinement included in a sentence of a court-martial begins to run from the date the sentence is adjudged by the court-martial, but periods during which the sentence to confinement is suspended or deferred shall be excluded in computing the service of the term of confinement.</p>

<p><strong>(d)</strong> On application by an accused who is under sentence to confinement that has not been ordered executed, the convening authority, or, if the accused is no longer under his jurisdiction, the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is currently assigned, may in his sole discretion defer service of the sentence to confinement. The deferment shall terminate when the sentence is ordered executed. The deferment may be rescinded at any time by the officer who granted it or, if the accused is no longer under his jurisdiction, by the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is currently assigned.</p>

<span>858. ART. 58. </span><h3>EXECUTION OF CONFINEMENT.</h3>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> Under such instructions as the Secretary concerned may prescribe, a sentence of confinement adjudged by a court-martial or other military tribunal, whether or not the sentence includes discharge or dismissal, and whether or not the discharge or dismissal has been executed, may be carried into execution by confinement in any place of confinement under the control of any of the armed forces or in any penal or correctional institution under the control of the United States, or which the United States may be allowed to use. Persons so confined in a penal or correctional institution not under the control of one of the armed forces are subject to the dame discipline and treatment as persons confined or committed by the courts of the United States or of the State, Territory, District of Columbia, or place in which the institution is situated.</p>

<p><strong>(b)</strong> The omission of the words "hard labor" from any sentence of a court- martial adjudging confinement does not deprive the authority executing that sentence of the power to require hard labor as a part of the punishment.</p>

<span>858a. ART. 58a. </span><h3>SENTENCES: REDUCTION IN ENLISTED GRADE UPON APPROVAL</h3>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> Unless otherwise provided in regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary concerned, a court-martial sentence of an enlisted member in pay grade above E-1, as approved by the convening authority, that includes--</p>

<span>859. ART. 59. </span><h3>ERROR OF LAW; LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE</h3>

<p><strong>(b)</strong> Any reviewing authority with the power to approve or affirm a finding of guilty may approve or affirm, instead, so much of the finding as includes a lesser included offense.</p>

<span>860. ART. 60. </span><h3>ACTION BY THE CONVENING AUTHORITY</h3>

<p><strong>(a)</strong> the findings and sentence of a court-martial shall be reported promptly to the convening authority after the announcement of the sentence.</p>

<p><strong>(b)</strong> (1) the accused may submit to the convening authority matters for consideration by the convening authority with respect to the findings and the sentence. Except in a summary court- martial case, such a submission shall be made within 10 days after the accused has been given an authenticated record of trial and, if applicable, the recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer under subsection (d). In a summary court-martial case, such submission shall be made within seven days after the sentence is announced.</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(2)</strong> If the accused shows that additional time is required for the accused to submit such matters, the convening authority or other person taking action under this section, for good cause, may extend the applicable period under paragraph (1) for not more than an additional 20 days.</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(3)</strong> In a summary court-martial case, the accused shall be promptly provided a copy of the record of trial for use in preparing a submission authorized by paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(4)</strong> The accused may waive his right to make a submission to the convening authority under paragraph (1). Such a waiver must be made in writing and may not be revoked. For the purposes of subsection (c)(2), the time within which the accused may make a submission under this subsection shall be deemed to have expired upon the submission of such a waiver to the convening authority.</p>

<p><strong>(c)</strong> (1) The authority under this section to modify the findings and sentence of a court-martial is a matter of command prerogative involving the sole discretion of the convening authority. Under regulations of the Secretary concerned, a commissioned officer commanding for the time being, a successor in command, or any person exercising general court-martial jurisdiction may act under this section in place of the convening authority.</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(2)</strong> Action on the sentence of a court-martial shall be taken by the convening authority or by another person authorized to act under this section. Subject to regulations of the Secretary concerned, such action may be taken only after consideration of any matters submitted by the accused under subsection (b) or after the time for submitting such matters expires, whichever is earlier. The convening authority or other person taking such action, in his sole discretion, may approve, disapprove, commute, or suspend the sentence in whole or in part.</p>

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(3)</strong> Action on the findings of a court-martial by the convening authority or other person acting on the sentence is not required. However, such person, in his sole discretion, may--</p>

<p class="indent indent-2"><strong>(A)</strong> dismiss any charge or specification by setting aside a finding of guilty thereto; or</p>

<p class="indent indent-2"><strong>(B)</strong> change a finding of guilty to a charge or specification to a finding of guilty to an offense that is a lesser included offense of the offense stated in the charge or specification.</p>

<p><strong>(d)</strong> Before acting under this section on any general court- martial case or any special court-martial case that includes a bad-conduct discharge, the convening authority or other person taking action under this section shall obtain and consider the written recommendation of his staff judge advocate or legal officer. The convening authority or other person taking action under this section shall refer the record of trial to his staff judge advocate or legal officer, and the staff judge advocate or legal officer shall use such record in the preparation of his recommendation.

<p class="indent indent-1"><strong>(2)</strong> A person who is eligible for any annuity under this section shall be paid that annuity if, at the time he becomes eligible to receive that annuity, he elects to receive that annuity in lieu of any other annuity for which he may be eligible at the time of such election (whether an immediate or a deferred annuity) under subchapter III of chapter 83 or subchapter II of chapter 84 of title 5 or any other retirement system for civilian employees of the Federal Government. Such an election may not be revoked.</p>
